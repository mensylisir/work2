    Enter the channel names to which to send notifications. Multiple values may appear comma separated. A custom username
    can be specified using 'username@channelname'. Channels should be entered as they appear in the url; rule of thumb is
    lower case with dashes instead of spaces.

    Examples: jenkins-test-server@builds, #build-channel, town-square, #off-topic

	It is possible to override this setting per project.
